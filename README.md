In this repo you will find the code samples for [SciPy Programming Succinctly](https://www.syncfusion.com/succinctly-free-ebooks/scipy-programming-succinctly) e-book.

As mentioned in their website, the e-book
>offers readers a quick, thorough grounding in knowledge of the Python open source extension SciPy. 

This code samples are expanded versions of the originals. Why? Because I'm experimenting with them while reading the book. Moreover, the originals are written in python 2, but this ones were translated to **python 3**.
