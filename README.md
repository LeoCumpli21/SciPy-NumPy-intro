In this repo you will find the code samples for [SciPy Programming Succinctly](https://www.syncfusion.com/succinctly-free-ebooks/scipy-programming-succinctly) e-book.

As mentioned in their website, the e-book
>offers readers a quick, thorough grounding in knowledge of the Python open source extension SciPy. 

This code samples are expanded versions of the originals. Why? Because I'm experimenting with them while reading the book.
